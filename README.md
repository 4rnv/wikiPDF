# WikiPDF

A simple application that generates text only PDFs of Wikipedia pages, without hyperlinks or cite notes. Useful for referencing.

This project was inspired by my childhood memories of using Wikipedia as a reference for school projects, only to be annoyed by the constant need to remove the cite notes and external links from the text.
